# geai

## Description
geai is an AI Geotechnical engineer that specializes in analyzing and interpreting geotechnical data. This project aims to provide a powerful and efficient tool for geotechnical engineers to perform various geotechnical analyses.

## Features
- Data analysis: geai can process and analyze geotechnical data, including soil properties, laboratory test results, and field measurements.
- Interpretation: geai can interpret the analyzed data and provide insights and recommendations for geotechnical engineering projects.
- Predictive modeling: geai can develop predictive models based on historical data to estimate geotechnical parameters and behavior.

## Installation
To use geai, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/geai.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python geai.py`

## Usage
Once geai is installed, you can use it by following these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules: `import geai`
2. Load your geotechnical data: `data = geai.load_data('data.csv')`
3. Analyze the data: `analysis = geai.analyze_data(data)`
4. Interpret the results: `interpretation = geai.interpret_results(analysis)`
5. Perform predictive modeling: `model = geai.build_model(data)`
6. Make predictions: `predictions = geai.predict(model, new_data)`
