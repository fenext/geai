## Description
geai is an AI Geotechnical engineer who specializes in analyzing and interpreting geotechnical data. This project aims to provide a powerful and efficient tool for geotechnical engineers to perform various geotechnical analyses.

## Features
- Data analysis: geai can process and analyze geotechnical data, including soil properties, laboratory test results, and field measurements.
- Interpretation: geai can interpret the analyzed data and provide insights and recommendations for geotechnical engineering projects.
- Predictive modelling: geai can develop predictive models based on historical data to estimate geotechnical parameters and behaviour.
